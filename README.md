## Thesis Topic
Comparative Study of Unreal Engine and Unity:
Capabilities, Game Development Implementation, and Guidance for New Developers.

## Description
This thesis presents a comparative analysis of Unreal Engine and Unity,
focusing on their capabilities, development workflows, performance,
and suitability for new developers.
Two game prototypes were implemented in both engines to evaluate
practical differences.

## Technologies
- Unreal Engine (C++)
- Unity (C#)
- Game Development
- 3D Graphics & Real-Time Rendering

## Projects
- Unreal project source: `/projects/unreal`
- Unity project source: `/projects/unity`

## Game Builds

Due to size limitations, executable builds are not included directly in this repository.

Playable versions of the game prototypes are available for download:

- 🎮 **Unity Engine build (Windows):**  
  [Download from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AsxDBeXbSoFu5HHkNgG0c_pjj6lGf2Qo/view)

- 🎮 **Unreal Engine build (Windows):**  
  [Download from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/107-Daxr8h6T4FHmwuQ78y4QKtAMj2kru/view)

Both builds implement the same gameplay concepts and mechanics and were developed
to compare workflows, performance characteristics, and the overall development
experience between Unity and Unreal Engine.
